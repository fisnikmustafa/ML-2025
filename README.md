## Dataset

## Overview

This repository focuses on developing a machine learning model to generate personalized fitness workout plans. The project leverages a dataset of fitness and workout data to create a tailored experience based on individual needs and goals. The ultimate aim is to help users optimize their workouts by recommending exercises, intensity, and schedules that align with their fitness levels and objectives.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that can analyze user fitness data and suggest effective workout plans. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to make fitness recommendations that are adaptive, efficient, and tailored to the specific needs of individuals.

## Phase 1: Preparing the Model

The first phase of this project focuses on preparing the dataset and building the foundational machine learning model. This includes:

**Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleaning, structuring, and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful features.

**Feature Engineering**: Identifying key variables that contribute to effective workout planning.

**Model Selection**: Evaluating different machine learning algorithms to determine the best approach for personalized recommendations.

**Baseline Model Developmen**t: Creating an initial model to test effectiveness and improve iteratively.
